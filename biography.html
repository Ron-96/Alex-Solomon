        <p class="biography-text">
            Born and raised in the small coastal town of Plettenberg Bay, Alex Solomon’s passion for music began at a young age.<br>
            However, it wasn’t until her teenage years that she discovered songwriting.<br>
            At 16, Alex started writing songs as an emotional outlet, but what began as a hobby quickly turned into a full-blown obsession.<br>
            Her growing passion eventually led her to leave her small hometown and move to Cape Town, where she now bases her music career.<br><br>
            
            She was soon discovered by renowned producer DJ Cosher, who saw potential in her sound and featured Solomon’s vocals on his track ‘Kiss Me’.<br>
            This became her debut on the South African radio scene, appearing on the Kfm Top 40 and marking a pivotal moment in her career.<br>
            The iconic radio host Carl Wastie introduced her to listeners, declaring, “Watch out for Alex Solomon, that’s a big, big name.”<br><br>
            
            Shortly after, Alex independently released her original debut single, ‘EX-GIRLFRIEND’, which premiered exclusively on the Kfm Top 40.<br>
            Carl Wastie praised the track, stating, “I feel like the world has found something better, and that’s Alex Solomon.”<br><br>
            
            The success of ‘EX-GIRLFRIEND’ marked the beginning of Alex’s rise to prominence in the South African music scene.<br>
            The single not only became a radio hit in South Africa but also garnered international recognition.<br>
            Her music was playlisted across major streaming platforms like Apple Music and Spotify, and she was featured on popular music blogs such as Texx and the City, along with a worldwide music video premiere on V13.<br><br>
            
            Building on her debut success, Alex continued to release hit after hit, with her tracks consistently charting on radio stations in both South Africa and abroad.<br>
            Notably, nearly all of her singles reached No. 1 spots on Australian station ValleyFM, and her single ‘No Platonic Male Friends’ held the No. 1 spot for two weeks on the 5FM Pop Nights Charts.<br><br>
            
            One of Alex’s defining moments came with the release of ‘Typical You’, a ballad that marked a departure from her usual upbeat pop sound.<br>
            The song, a heartfelt exploration of complicated romantic dynamics, quickly made waves across South Africa.<br>
            It was premiered once again on Kfm, further solidifying her place in the South African music landscape and demonstrating her versatility as an artist.<br>
            ‘Typical You’ resonated deeply with her audience, showcasing Alex’s ability to connect on an emotional level.<br>
